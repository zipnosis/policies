# Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Zipnosis understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Zipnosis is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Zipnosis has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Zipnosis Customers to support data retention laws.

## State Medical Record Laws

## Data Retention Policy

* Current Zipnosis Customers have data stored by Zipnosis as a part of the Zipnosis Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
	1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
	2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Zipnosis and/or to have Zipnosis continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, Zipnosis will work with Customer to determine storage costs.
	3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Zipnosis within 30 days, Zipnosis removed data from Zipnosis systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
